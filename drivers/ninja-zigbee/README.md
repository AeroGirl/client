#NinjaBlocks Node.js ZigBee Driver

## Requirements
- TI CC2531 USB dongle programmed as a ZigBee Network Processor
- NinjaBlocks client (You can test without it.)
- Linux (ARM/x64) or OSX

## Usage
To add devices, follow the instructions at http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/ZigBee_Lighting_Gateway#Connecting_ZigBee_devices_to_the_Gateway

If the device is recognized by this driver, it will be exposed via NinjaBlocks onto your dashboard.

If the device is *not* recognized, debug information will be printed to your log. Post this information to http://forums.ninjablocks.com and hopefully one of the friendly ninjas will be able to get it working for you.
